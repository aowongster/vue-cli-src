# vue-cli-src

> A Vue.js project

The code in here is what you get when you run `vue init webpack vue-cli-src` with all the options toggled 'Y'. I wanted a place to see and poke through the files to help me learn vue-cli scaffolding better.

```
vue init webpack vue-cli-src
cd vue-cli-src
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
